              Basic self-defence
            </h2>
            <p class="lg:text-lg">
              Our basic self-defence course will give you knowledge in how to spot and avoid trouble, then if all else fails
              a few simple self-defence/breakaway techniques to get you away from the trouble and home safe. Very few
              fights/attacks are a total surprise and if you can read the situation correctly you will be able to walk away
              before any escalation into violence. Random attacks do happen, but they are such a small percentage of overall
              violent situations.

          <p class="lg:text-lg md:col-span-7 md:col-start-1">
            All our courses incorporate self-awareness and situational awareness, meaning you should be able to spot even
            a potential random attack if you follow common sense and the subtle signs and definitely be able to walk away
            from the usual street violence we see in the UK. We will cover the signs of trouble, body language, verbal
            escalation, conflict resolution and de-escalation. We will cover UK law and self-defence, the do’s and don’ts
            and potential pitfalls you could face with common myths and misconceptions that are widely spread in society.

          <p class="lg:text-lg md:col-span-7 md:col-start-6">
            We cover how the body and mind react to a fearful situation and the implications this can bring if you lose
            control, (easier said than done but we can teach breathing techniques and awareness to calm you down in a
            violent encounter). If all else has failed we will teach you very simple but effective self-defence moves that
            if done correctly will get you out of a violent encounter. These moves are tried and tested through years of
            experience from myself and my mentors, plus other training partners who have worked in violent environments
            such as security and door supervisors.

                  The way women have to conduct themselves in society is sadly very different to men. The way women fight is
                  also different to men, physiology and mindset play a large factor in this. Our women’s self-defence course
                  will take these factors into account and teach a more practical approach to self-defence than the basic
                  self-defence course. All the topics covered in the basic self-defence course will still be covered, but in
                  a way that is more beneficial to women, in addition we will cover sexual predators and sexual attacks if
                  required.

                  Again, we look to break down myths and common misconceptions around women’s self-defence, meaning that you
                  will have a new found confidence in your day-to-day abilities to stay safe.

                  and verbal signs, situational positioning and safety in a property, signs of escalation, de-escalation
                  techniques, conflict resolution techniques, power talking and your own body language, break away and

                  In an ever-decreasing respect for life in our current society, this course will look at trying to stay
                  safe if you encounter someone with a weapon. From the very start of this course, we will debunk the common
                  misconception of Hollywood self-defence and weapons/techniques. There is no good situation if you are
                  faced by an attacker with a weapon, it is damage limitation, not damage eradication unfortunately. That
                  being said we will use street techniques and techniques that take into account physiology to defend
                  yourself so that you survive.

                <p class="lg:text-lg">
                  We look at a range of weapons that you may face on the street as well, not just edged weapons. We advise
                  on UK law and again get rid of myths and misconceptions around carrying or using weapons for self-defence.
                  Again, all of the topics in the basic self-defence course will be covered alongside the implication of a
                  weapon. The session will conclude with the white t-shirt exercise, this highlights the difficulty in
                  staying safe when faced off against someone with a weapon.

                  fear in an adverse situation where you are being threatened or even attacked. The focus on this course is
                  as Dave Turton quite rightly said, it‘s not what you can’t do, but what you can do within your physical
                  restraints.

                  restrictions caused by the likes of a heart attack, a broken limb, having to use crutches a walking stick
                  or a wheelchair. We will show useful and easy escapes and techniques to hopefully keep you safe, which

                  There is a call from sectors such as education that require basic self-defence instruction for students.
                  It will cover all the topics in the basic self-defence course but will give you the ability to be able to
                  teach the course yourself. On completion of this course and after assessment you will be able to take the
                  basic self-defence course yourself. There will still be full back up and support from Instincts, we won’t
                  just throw you out and say get on with it. You will however have to come back every 12 months for updates
                  and competency assessments.
