          Highly experienced professional with over 30 years’ experience across multiple roles in a range of
          organisations. A persuasive leader responsible for planning, organising, prioritising objectives within a
          business organisation, able to adjust my management style to suit different environments. Colleague and
          customer engagement is a priority and evidence of robust talent and succession plans in place. Determined,
          tenacious, organised, self-motivated approach to all aspects of my role including customer service,
          operational demands, trading legally, budgeting effectively, also delivering annual growth.

          I am very interested in well-being and making a difference everyday. People and inclusion are very important
          to me so I will be bringing that passion into our daily way of working. Having a life balance is also a big
          factor and this now feels achievable with the creation of Instincts. The original idea for Instincts came as a
          result of feedback over the years that I should work for myself, so finally having the knowledge, confidence
          and skills, Instincts was founded.
