        <p>
          I have worked in retail management most of my career, I then took a career break. This break allowed me the
          time
          to complete courses and start a new business with my partner. There have been many occasions in a front-facing
          role where I would have loved the training that Instincts provide, leading to a better understanding of
          myself,
          my responses and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided at this time to take training courses to boost my CV and give me alternative qualifications and
          experiences. The courses I have completed are:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>Mental Health First Aider Level 2</li>
          <li>PTLLS Education and Training Level 3</li>
          <li>NCFE Creating a Business Start up Level 2</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Instincts Training Ltd, offers bespoke training to a range of organisations, from lone working to well being
          and
          life skills for all. The focus is personal awareness and safety enabling you to make the right decision at the
          right time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am very interested in well-being and making a difference everyday. People and inclusion are very important
          to
          me so I will be bringing that passion into our daily way of working. Having a life balance is also a big
          factor
          and this now feels achievable with the creation of Instincts. The original idea for Instincts came as a result
          of feedback over the years that I should work for myself, so finally having the knowledge, confidence and
          skills, Instincts was founded.
