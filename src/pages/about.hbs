        I am very interested in well-being and making a difference everyday. People and inclusion are very important
        to me so I will be bringing that passion into our daily way of working. Having a life balance is also a big
        factor and this now feels achievable with the creation of Instincts. The original idea for Instincts came as a
        result of feedback over the years that I should work for myself, so finally having the knowledge, confidence
        and skills, Instincts was founded.
