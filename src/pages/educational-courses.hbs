          Our educational courses tackle the subject of anti-social behaviour, whether that be violence, harassment,
          misogyny, or consent. Our courses are designed to address why we should not be heading down these paths to
          criminality.
        </p>
        <p class="lg:text-lg">
          We very often tell people what they should not be doing but fail to expand on the why. By describing
          consequences, whether it be psychological or criminal we explore how the path to criminality never ends well
          no matter what side or angle you look at it from.

            parties concerned.
