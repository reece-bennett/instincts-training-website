          Basic personal safety
        </h2>
        <p class="lg:text-lg">
          Our basic personal safety course will give you knowledge in how to spot and avoid trouble, then if all else
          fails a few simple personal safety/breakaway techniques to get you away from the trouble and home safe. Very
          few fights/attacks are a total surprise and if you can read the situation correctly you will be able to walk
          away before any escalation into violence. Random attacks do happen, but they are such a small percentage of
          overall violent situations.
        </p>

      <p class="lg:text-lg md:col-span-7 md:col-start-1">
        All our courses incorporate self-awareness and situational awareness, meaning you should be able to spot even
        a potential random attack if you follow common sense and the subtle signs and definitely be able to walk away
        from the usual street violence we see in the UK. We will cover the signs of trouble, body language, verbal
        escalation, conflict resolution and de-escalation. We will cover UK law and personal safety, the do’s and don’ts
        and potential pitfalls you could face with common myths and misconceptions that are widely spread in society.
      </p>

      <p class="lg:text-lg md:col-span-7 md:col-start-6">
        We cover how the body and mind react to a fearful situation and the implications this can bring if you lose
        control, (easier said than done but we can teach breathing techniques and awareness to calm you down in a
        violent encounter). If all else has failed we will teach you very simple but effective personal safety moves
        that if done correctly will get you out of a violent encounter. These moves are tried and tested through years
        of experience from myself and my mentors, plus other training partners who have worked in violent environments
        such as security and door supervisors.

          Specialised courses
        </h2>
        <p class="lg:text-lg">
          The following courses incorporate the fundamentals of the basic personal safety course, then specialise in the
          actual topic.

      <div class="border-t border-neutral-400">
        {{#> accordion-item index=1 title="Women’s personal safety"}}
          <p class="lg:text-lg">
            The way women have to conduct themselves in society is sadly very different to men. The way women fight is
            also different to men, physiology and mindset play a large factor in this. Our women’s personal safety
            course will take these factors into account and teach a more practical approach to personal safety than
            the basic personal safety course. All the topics covered in the basic personal safety course will still be
            covered, but in a way that is more beneficial to women, in addition we will cover sexual predators and
            sexual attacks if required.
          </p>
          <p class="lg:text-lg">
            The techniques are tailored to take into account what you can actually do and not what you can’t do.
            Again, we look to break down myths and common misconceptions around women’s personal safety, meaning that
            you will have a new found confidence in your day-to-day abilities to stay safe.

        {{#> accordion-item index=2 title="Lone worker" cpd-certified=true}}
          <p class="lg:text-lg">
            In this course we look at keeping the lone worker safe in their employment environment. We start at the
            very beginning of any tasked job and break it down in stages asking if a visit is actually necessary to a
            clients address or has human nature opted for an easy get out.
          </p>
          <p class="lg:text-lg">
            We will look again at situational and spatial awareness, common sense, location to visit, aesthetics of an
            area or property and what clues this could give us, dynamic risk assessments, escape plans, body language
            and verbal signs, situational positioning and safety in a property, signs of escalation, de-escalation
            techniques, conflict resolution techniques, power talking and your own body language, break away and
            personal safety techniques, and reporting. We also look at the law surrounding employers/employees,
            personal safety in the house and in general and potential weapons involvement.
          </p>
          <p class="lg:text-lg">
            This course is <a href="https://cpduk.co.uk/providers/instincts-training" class="underline hover:text-shadow-bold">CPD certified</a>
            and contributes to 2 hours of accredited training for continuous personal development.

        {{#> accordion-item index=3 title="Conflict resolution & breakaway techniques"}}
          <p class="lg:text-lg">
            With this one the course is based around front facing staff and employees, whether that be in retail or
            customer service, security or public stewards at an event. The course will take you through the stages of
            escalation. What to look out for. Anger, frustration and fear. Body language, tone of voice and trigger
            words. How to be assertive without causing offence. Conflict resolution and de-escalation techniques and
            scenarios. If all else fails, simple breakaway techniques that are proven to work, allowing you to keep a
            safe distance and maintain control.
          </p>
        {{/accordion-item}}
        {{#> accordion-item index=4 title="Weapons"}}
          <p class="lg:text-lg">
            In an ever-decreasing respect for life in our current society, this course will look at trying to stay
            safe if you encounter someone with a weapon. From the very start of this course, we will debunk the common
            misconception of Hollywood personal safety and weapons/techniques. There is no good situation if you are
            faced by an attacker with a weapon, it is damage limitation, not damage eradication unfortunately. That
            being said we will use street techniques and techniques that take into account physiology to defend
            yourself so that you survive.
          </p>
          <p class="lg:text-lg">
            We look at a range of weapons that you may face on the street as well, not just edged weapons. We advise
            on UK law and again get rid of myths and misconceptions around carrying or using weapons for personal
            safety. Again, all of the topics in the basic personal safety course will be covered alongside the
            implication of a weapon. The session will conclude with the white t-shirt exercise, this highlights the
            difficulty in staying safe when faced off against someone with a weapon.
          </p>
        {{/accordion-item}}
        {{#> accordion-item index=5 title="Advanced personal safety"}}
          <p class="lg:text-lg">
            You will need to have covered the basic personal safety course to participate in this one. It will recap
            on everything the basic personal safety has taught you and then expand. It will cover more technical
            applications and adaptations to what you already know, it will also cover adverse situations. This could
            be personal safety on the floor, multiple attackers, and trapped scenarios such as being attacked in your
            car seat through the window (road rage is very common these days).
          </p>
        {{/accordion-item}}
        {{#> accordion-item index=6 title="Physical restrictions personal safety"}}
          <p class="lg:text-lg">
            There are many of us who carry a disability in our everyday lives, this can be a cause for anxiety and
            fear in an adverse situation where you are being threatened or even attacked. The focus on this course is
            as Dave Turton quite rightly said, it‘s not what you can’t do, but what you can do within your physical
            restraints.
          </p>
          <p class="lg:text-lg">
            This course is derived from several true-life experiences and having to re-think how we behave mentally
            and physically while carrying a disability, whether that be the likes of Fibro Myalgia, internal physical
            restrictions caused by the likes of a heart attack, a broken limb, having to use crutches a walking stick
            or a wheelchair. We will show useful and easy escapes and techniques to hopefully keep you safe, which
            will boost your confidence enabling you to make the most out of every day.
          </p>

        {{#> accordion-item index=7 title="Basic personal safety instructors course"}}
          <p class="lg:text-lg">
            This course will give you the knowledge and skills to teach the basic levels of personal safety. The
            course is accredited by Dave Turton himself and the SDF Association, it has been developed due to a need
            and desire to be able to teach basic levels of personal safety to all. The course can potentially be a
            source of income for anyone who passes, to take into establishments and give people the knowledge to stay
            safe.
          </p>
          <p class="lg:text-lg">
            There is a call from sectors such as education that require basic personal safety instruction for
            students. It will cover all the topics in the basic personal safety course but will give you the ability
            to be able to teach the course yourself. On completion of this course and after assessment you will be
            able to take the basic personal safety course yourself. There will still be full back up and support from
            Instincts, we won’t just throw you out and say get on with it. You will however have to come back every 12
            months for updates and competency assessments.
