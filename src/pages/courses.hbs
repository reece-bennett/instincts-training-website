          Basic self-defence
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg">
          Our basic self-defence course will give you knowledge in how to spot and avoid trouble, then if all else fails
          a few simple self-defence/breakaway techniques to get you away from the trouble and home safe. Very few
          fights/attacks are a total surprise and if you can read the situation correctly you will be able to walk away
          before any escalation into violence. Random attacks do happen, but they are such a small percentage of overall
          violent situations.
        </p>

      <div class="col-span-7">
        <p class="text-lg">
          All our courses incorporate self-awareness and situational awareness, meaning you should be able to spot even
          a potential random attack if you follow common sense and the subtle signs and definitely be able to walk away
          from the usual street violence we see in the UK. We will cover the signs of trouble, body language, verbal
          escalation, conflict resolution and de-escalation. We will cover UK law and self-defence, the do’s and don’ts
          and potential pitfalls you could face with common myths and misconceptions that are widely spread in society.
        </p>

          We cover how the body and mind react to a fearful situation and the implications this can bring if you lose
          control, (easier said than done but we can teach breathing techniques and awareness to calm you down in a
          violent encounter). If all else has failed we will teach you very simple but effective self-defence moves that
          if done correctly will get you out of a violent encounter. These moves are tried and tested through years of
          experience from myself and my mentors, plus other training partners who have worked in violent environments
          such as security and door supervisors.

        <p class="text-lg">
          The following courses incorporate the fundamentals of the basic self-defence course, then specialise in the
          actual topic.

          </div>
          <p class="text-lg">
            The way women have to conduct themselves in society is sadly very different to men. The way women fight is
            also different to men, physiology and mindset play a large factor in this. Our women’s self-defence course
            will take these factors into account and teach a more practical approach to self-defence than the basic
            self-defence course. All the topics covered in the basic self-defence course will still be covered, but in a
            way that is more beneficial to women, in addition we will cover sexual predators and sexual attacks if
            required.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg">
            The techniques are tailored to take into account what you can actually do and not what you can’t do. Again,
            we look to break down myths and common misconceptions around women’s self-defence, meaning that you will
            have a new found confidence in your day-to-day abilities to stay safe.
