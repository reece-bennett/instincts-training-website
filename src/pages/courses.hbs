          Basic self-defence
        </h2>
        <p class="lg:text-lg">
          Our basic self-defence course will give you knowledge in how to spot and avoid trouble, then if all else fails
          a few simple self-defence/breakaway techniques to get you away from the trouble and home safe. Very few
          fights/attacks are a total surprise and if you can read the situation correctly you will be able to walk away
          before any escalation into violence. Random attacks do happen, but they are such a small percentage of overall
          violent situations.

      <p class="lg:text-lg md:col-span-7 md:col-start-1">
        All our courses incorporate self-awareness and situational awareness, meaning you should be able to spot even
        a potential random attack if you follow common sense and the subtle signs and definitely be able to walk away
        from the usual street violence we see in the UK. We will cover the signs of trouble, body language, verbal
        escalation, conflict resolution and de-escalation. We will cover UK law and self-defence, the do’s and don’ts
        and potential pitfalls you could face with common myths and misconceptions that are widely spread in society.

      <p class="lg:text-lg md:col-span-7 md:col-start-6">
        We cover how the body and mind react to a fearful situation and the implications this can bring if you lose
        control, (easier said than done but we can teach breathing techniques and awareness to calm you down in a
        violent encounter). If all else has failed we will teach you very simple but effective self-defence moves that
        if done correctly will get you out of a violent encounter. These moves are tried and tested through years of
        experience from myself and my mentors, plus other training partners who have worked in violent environments
        such as security and door supervisors.

              The way women have to conduct themselves in society is sadly very different to men. The way women fight is
              also different to men, physiology and mindset play a large factor in this. Our women’s self-defence course
              will take these factors into account and teach a more practical approach to self-defence than the basic
              self-defence course. All the topics covered in the basic self-defence course will still be covered, but in
              a way that is more beneficial to women, in addition we will cover sexual predators and sexual attacks if
              required.
            </p>
            <p class="lg:text-lg">
              The techniques are tailored to take into account what you can actually do and not what you can’t do.
              Again, we look to break down myths and common misconceptions around women’s self-defence, meaning that you
              will have a new found confidence in your day-to-day abilities to stay safe.

              In this course we look at keeping the lone worker safe in their employment environment. We start at the
              very beginning of any tasked job and break it down in stages asking if a visit is actually necessary to a
              clients address or has human nature opted for an easy get out.
            </p>
            <p class="lg:text-lg">
              We will look again at situational and spatial awareness, common sense, location to visit, aesthetics of an
              area or property and what clues this could give us, dynamic risk assessments, escape plans, body language
              and verbal signs, situational positioning and safety in a property, signs of escalation, de-escalation
              techniques, conflict resolution techniques, power talking and your own body language, break away and
              self-defence techniques, and reporting. We also look at the law surrounding employers/employees,
              self-defence in the house and in general and potential weapons involvement.

              In an ever-decreasing respect for life in our current society, this course will look at trying to stay
              safe if you encounter someone with a weapon. From the very start of this course, we will debunk the common
              misconception of Hollywood self-defence and weapons/techniques. There is no good situation if you are
              faced by an attacker with a weapon, it is damage limitation, not damage eradication unfortunately. That
              being said we will use street techniques and techniques that take into account physiology to defend
              yourself so that you survive.
            </p>
            <p class="lg:text-lg">
              We look at a range of weapons that you may face on the street as well, not just edged weapons. We advise
              on UK law and again get rid of myths and misconceptions around carrying or using weapons for self-defence.
              Again, all of the topics in the basic self-defence course will be covered alongside the implication of a
              weapon. The session will conclude with the white t-shirt exercise, this highlights the difficulty in
              staying safe when faced off against someone with a weapon.

              You will need to have covered the basic self-defence course to participate in this one. It will recap on

              applications and adaptations to what you already know, it will also cover adverse situations. This could
              be self-defence on the floor, multiple attackers, and trapped scenarios such as being attacked in your car
              seat through the window (road rage is very common these days).

              There are many of us who carry a disability in our everyday lives, this can be a cause for anxiety and
              fear in an adverse situation where you are being threatened or even attacked. The focus on this course is
              as Dave Turton quite rightly said, it‘s not what you can’t do, but what you can do within your physical
              restraints.

              This course is derived from several true-life experiences and having to re-think how we behave mentally
              and physically while carrying a disability, whether that be the likes of Fibro Myalgia, internal physical
              restrictions caused by the likes of a heart attack, a broken limb, having to use crutches a walking stick
              or a wheelchair. We will show useful and easy escapes and techniques to hopefully keep you safe, which
              will boost your confidence enabling you to make the most out of every day.

              This course will give you the knowledge and skills to teach the basic levels of self-defence. The course
              is accredited by Dave Turton himself and the SDF Association, it has been developed due to a need and
              desire to be able to teach basic levels of self-defence to all. The course can potentially be a source of
              income for anyone who passes, to take into establishments and give people the knowledge to stay safe.

              There is a call from sectors such as education that require basic self-defence instruction for students.
              It will cover all the topics in the basic self-defence course but will give you the ability to be able to
              teach the course yourself. On completion of this course and after assessment you will be able to take the
              basic self-defence course yourself. There will still be full back up and support from Instincts, we won’t
              just throw you out and say get on with it. You will however have to come back every 12 months for updates
              and competency assessments.
